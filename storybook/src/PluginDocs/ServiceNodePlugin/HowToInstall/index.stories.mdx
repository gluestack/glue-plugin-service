# How to Install

##

<br/>

* To add a custom service to your Gluestack project, you can use the following command in the root directory of your project:

  ```sh
  $ node glue add service:add
  ```

* During the installation process, you will be prompted to select a service type, such as **service-node**.

     <br/>

    <img src='/assets/select-service.png' />

    <br />


* Once you have selected your desired service type, you will be prompted to provide an **instance name** for your service.

    <br/> 

    <img src='/assets/instance-name.png' />

     <br/>


* For example, let's say we want to install an instance named **authservice** in our **Gluestack** project.

  <br/>

* After a successful installation, you should see a new directory named **authservice**, located in the **backend/services** folder of your project. This directory will contain all the necessary files and folders for your service, allowing you to customize it according to your needs.

   ```jsx
      ðŸ“‚backend
      â”— ðŸ“‚services
          â”— ðŸ“‚authservice
    ```
