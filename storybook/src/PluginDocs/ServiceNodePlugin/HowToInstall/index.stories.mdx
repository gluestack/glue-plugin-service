# How to install



<br/>

* To start using **node service** in your application, you need to run the following command:

  <br/>

    ```bash
    $ node glue service:add
    ```

  <br/>
  <br/>

* After running the above command, it will ask you for selecting a language for your **microservice**, and there you need to select **@gluestack/glue-plugin-service-node** as your language for the **microservice**.

  <br/>


* After this it will ask you for **instance-name** of your microservice, you can give the name of your instance whatever you want.

  <br/>

* After successfully providing the details it will automatically install **@gluestack/glue-plugin-service-node**.

  <br/>

* **For example**, if you want to add a microservice named **auth-service** then you need to follow the following steps:

    First enter the following command to add a service:

    ```bash
    $ node glue service:add
    ```

    After running the above command, it will ask you for selecting a language for your **service**, as shown below:

    <br/>

    After this it will ask you for **instance-name** of your service, as shown below:

    <img src="/assets/serviceName.png"/>

    In above image it is **auth-service**.

    After providing these details it will automatically install **@gluestack/glue-plugin-service-node** as shown below:

    <img src="/assets/serviceInstall.png"/>

    <br/>

  <br/>


* If everything goes well and the plugin is installed successfully then you can go and see that inside **backend** folder there is folder named “**services**” and inside that **services** folder, there is a new folder which is named after your instance is created. 
  
  Overall directory path for the above example will be something like this:
  
  **backend/services/auth-service**
