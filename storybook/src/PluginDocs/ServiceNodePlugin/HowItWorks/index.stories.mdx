# How It Works

##

<br/>

* ## Working
  
  <br/>
  
  * **Service-Node** plugin will help you in creating microservices written in **node.js**
  
  
  <br/>
  
  
  * Every service you create via **service-node** will be running with a **Dapr Sidecar** which is managed by your **Backend-Engine** plugin.
  
  
  <br/>
  
  
  * Inside every service you have created, you can attach your own **functions** and **graphql actions**.
  
  <br/>
  
  * Your **Backend-Engine** plugin will treat every service as a seperate independent microservice. Behind the scene it will handle everything. Like providing you baseurl to interact with your service.
  
  <br/>

  * If for example you have added a service whose instance name is **auth-service** via **glue plugin service node** then you will get a folder named **auth-service** inside your **services** folder, where your whole logic of service is written.

  <br/>

  
  * Your directory stucture for the above example should be something like this:

    <br/>

    ```jsx
      ðŸ“¦auth-service
        â”£ ðŸ“‚components
        â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œfunction.yaml
        â”£ ðŸ“‚functions
        â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚function
        â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œhandler.js
        â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚health-check
        â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œhandler.js
        â”£ ðŸ“‚helpers
        â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œloader.js
        â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œreplace-special-chars.js
        â”£ ðŸ“œ.env
        â”£ ðŸ“œ.env.example
        â”£ ðŸ“œDockerfile
        â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
        â”£ ðŸ“œpackage.json
        â”£ ðŸ“œrouter.js
        â”— ðŸ“œserver.js
    ```
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  * In order to start your service you need to run the following command:
    
    <br/>
    
    ```bash
      $ node glue develop:up
    ```
    
    <br/>

    This command will start running the docker image of all the instances and plugin you have created. Here, in this case it will start running your **service instance** ypu have created, inside your **Backend-Engine** container.
  
  <br/>
  
  * In order to interact with your there is a file named **router.js** present in root directory of the service instance. If you open that **router.js** file, you will see a string value attached to a key named **path**, this is the string which you need to append after your nginx url(http://localhost:9090).
  
    For example we already have a service named **auth-service** then router.js value will be something like this:
    
      ```jsx
      module.exports = () => [
        {
          "path": "/backend/authservice/(.*)",
          "proxy": {
            "instance": "authservice:3500",
            "path": "/v1.0/invoke/authservice/method/$1"
          }
        }
      ];

      ```
    
    <br/>
    
    So in order to access your service instance for example **auth-service** its base url should be something like this,
      
      
    **http://localhost:9090/backend/authservice**
  
  <br/>

* ## Instructions to start development with serive-node plugin
  
  <br/>
  
  * Inside your **service instance directory** which you have created via **glue-plugin-service-node**, you will find a file named **server.js** which is an express app.

  <br/>

  * Whatever functions and graphql actions you have created via **glue-plugin-service-node** will be attached to this express app.

  <br/>

  * There is a folder named functions in root of you **service instance** directory, inside this folder you will find all the **functions** and **graphql actions** you have created for your service.

  <br/>

  * Inside every functions and graphql directory there is a file named handler.js, this is the file where you will write your logic.

  <br/>

  * Inside your action directory you will find a file named **action.graphql**, this is the file where you will write types for your action.

  <br/>

  * Below is an example of how you can write types for your **action.graphql** file:

    ```js
    type Mutation {
      myFirstAction (input: actionInput!): actionResponse
    }

    input actionInput {
      email: String!
      password: String!
    }

    type actionResponse {
      status: Boolean!
      message: String!
    }

    ```

  <br />

  * Inside your action directory you will find a file named **action.setting**, this is the file where you can add settings for your actions like **action execution type** and **action role permissions**.

  <br/>

  * Below is an example of how you can configure settings in **action.setting** file:

    ```
    execution = "sync"
    roles = "admin,staff"
    ```
