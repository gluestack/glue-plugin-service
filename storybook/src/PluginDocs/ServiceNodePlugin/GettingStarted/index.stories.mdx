# Getting Started

##

<br/>

This plugin provides you with an **Express app** that has basic functionality already built-in. This allows you to focus on writing your **custom logic** and building your service without having to worry about setting up the basic functionality. You have the flexibility to customize the service according to your needs and preferences.
